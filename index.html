          <p>Although me of all people would have been the last to say I’d grow up to love this discipline, learning to code has been the most rewarding challenge of my life. Two things that have persistently interested me throughout my life are understanding how things work and creating things. This first manifested as a love for art, then psychology, and now coding; all of which adding value to the next. Tackling logic problems using a medium that allows me to build and create things is what I have found to love in learning the languages of modern technology.
            Although the drive for solving problems and creating things was always there, it was GA’s Web Development Immersive course that allowed me to channel these interests into learning a tool that has endless possibilities for enhancing human experience across a magnitude of sectors.</p>
