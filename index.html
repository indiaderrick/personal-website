          <p>Although me of all people would have been the last to say I’d grow up to love this discipline, learning to code has been the most <span> rewarding challenge of my life </span>. Two things that have persistently interested me throughout my life are understanding <span>how things work</span> and <span>creating things</span>. This first manifested as a love for art, then psychology, and now coding; all of which adding value to the next. Tackling logic problems using a medium that allows me to build and create things is what I have found to love in learning the languages of modern technology.
            Although the <span>drive for solving problems</span> and creating things was always there, it was GA’s Web Development Immersive course that allowed me to <span>channel these interests</span> into learning a tool that has endless possibilities for enhancing human experience across a magnitude of sectors.</p>
